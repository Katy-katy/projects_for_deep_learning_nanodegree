some projects using python, tensorflow, keras

1. **Dog Breed Classifier** (CNN, TensorFlow). I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm can identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
2. **Generate TV Scripts** Generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network.
3. **Face Generation** (DCGAN, TensorFlow). In this project, I am using generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
